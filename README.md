# Crafting Connections: Building Wellbeing and Community in the PhD Journey

PhD students are six times more likely to develop mental health issues than the general public, with international students at higher
risk due to a lack of social support. We propose this workshop, focusing on using craft for fostering wellbeing and community
connection, would be beneficial because everyone can share how they approach wellbeing in their workspaces, and experience first
hand how crafting activities have positively impacted the work environment of the organisers’ reading group. Workshop attendees
will get to experience crafting activities from four different cultures, each with a tradition of community building and/or wellness; and
contribute to a discussion on strategies to support HDR wellbeing Australia-wide.

We welcome participants of all academic levels who like the idea of meeting people while making beautiful things, and
who work in diverse teams and want to try new ways to include others and connect.
Position papers are not required for this workshop, but in advance of the workshop, we will ask everyone attending to
submit an image of something that represents wellbeing and/or connection to you, for use in our icebreaker activity.

In this workshop, we will explore the connection between crafting and wellbeing through hands-on experience with
crafting activities from four different cultures. Participants will discuss and reflect on their experiences in academia, the
HDR journey, and how they perceive wellbeing for themselves and their colleagues.
During the workshop, we will create a poster that captures how participants perceive wellbeing and connectedness
at the start and the end of the workshop, to capture how the crafts and their histories influence attendees’ perspectives.
We would like to display this poster as part of the OzCHI Posters stream, if this is possible.
We intend to gather information from workshop participants about how the OzCHI community supports HDR
wellbeing. After the workshop, the organisers will write a workshop report to highlight best practices, and provide
recommendations for incorporating crafting activities into HDR support.

This is a half day workshop structured around crafting and self reflection. On the day participants will take part in two
different crafts and a reflection task. The day is structured as follows:
