# Crafting Connections 
## Building Wellbeing and Community in the PhD Journey 

PhD students are six times more likely to develop mental health issues than the general public, with international students at higher
risk due to a lack of social support. We propose this workshop, focusing on using craft for fostering wellbeing and community
connection, would be beneficial because everyone can share how they approach wellbeing in their workspaces, and experience first
hand how crafting activities have positively impacted the work environment of the organisers’ reading group. Workshop attendees
will get to experience crafting activities from four different cultures, each with a tradition of community building and/or wellness; and
contribute to a discussion on strategies to support HDR wellbeing Australia-wide.

## Workshop and Activities
In this workshop, we will explore the connection between crafting and wellbeing through hands-on experience with
crafting activities from four different cultures. Participants will discuss and reflect on their experiences in academia, the
HDR journey, and how they perceive wellbeing for themselves and their colleagues.
During the workshop, we will create a poster that captures how participants perceive wellbeing and connectedness
at the start and the end of the workshop, to capture how the crafts and their histories influence attendees’ perspectives.
We intend to gather information from workshop participants about how the OzCHI community supports HDR
wellbeing. 

## Attending
We welcome participants of all academic levels who like the idea of meeting people while making beautiful things, and
 who work in diverse teams and want to try new ways to include others and connect.
 Position papers are not required for this workshop, but in advance of the workshop, we ask you to
 submit an image of something that represents wellbeing and/or connection to you, for use in our icebreaker activity.

## Activities
### European Loom Knitting facilitated by Alexandra Douglass-Bonner. 

Knitting is a tradition of crafting fabric from one continuous thread by looping or "knotting". One of the earliest looms, a Lucet, was found in France in dating back
 to the 10th Century. Due to their small size and simplicity, knitting looms can make knitting more accessible as they do
 not require thread tension to be held in your hands. Alex’s grandma taught her to knit cords on a loom around the age
 of 3, and she came back to loom knitting years later to make hats for her friends. During the workshop she will show
 you some simple stitches that make up all garments, building connections and fostering discussions on a wide range of
 topics. She hopes to share some of her passion for this craft, and hear about your passions and hobbies in return.
 
### Indonesian Wayang Making facilitated by Agata Filiana. 
 
 Wayang refers to a type of traditional shadow puppet
 made from leather and decorated with different colours commonly used in performances in Indonesia, particularly Java
 and Bali. Wayang performance typically includes a gamelan performance and a dalang, who leads the shadow
 performance. A wayang performance is often seen more than just for entertainment purposes, but also a spiritual
 experience that include epic storytelling, philosophical messages and humour. You will make your own wayang
 characters using paper. You will carefully select the colours that represent your wayang character, just as each wayang
 has their own colour symbolism. Agata will lead discussions on how Indonesian culture uses storytelling to pass on
 generational wisdom of wellbeing and the benefits of gathering as a community to strengthen one’s social connection.
 She invites attendees to reflect and share their own stories on these topics.
 
### Turkish İznik Tile Decorating facilitated by Rabia Nur Kilic. 

İznik tiles have decorated Turkish mosques and palaces
 for over 500 years, with their distinctive cobalt blues, deep reds, and intricate patterns becoming symbols of Turkish
 cultural identity. These traditional designs still appear throughout modern Turkish life—on teacups, ceramics, and
 home décor, reflecting their enduring legacy. You will color pre-made İznik tile patterns on paper plates, exploring
 the symbolic meanings behind different motifs and colors. Many patterns represent joy, memory, or spiritual themes
 that you can interpret through your own creative lens. Rabia will share how these artistic traditions connect
 to Turkish identity and daily life, while encouraging participants to discuss their own cultural symbols and artistic
 practices.
 
### Sri Lankan Padura Weaving facilitated by Manesha Andradi. 
The padura (woven mat) is a cultural item that can be found in all Sri Lankan homes. It is used as a bed, a dining table, musical performance space and more. Padura weaving can be a meditative experience for the crafter and is sometimes done while reciting kavi (folk poetry). This workshop aims to teach the basics of padura weaving using paper while Manesha shares aspects of Sri Lankan culture that support her wellbeing such as crafting, focusing on community, and prioritising ecological sustainability. In a cultural exchange, she invites attendees to discuss their own approaches to these topics while weaving together.
